Final project Agile retrospective 


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The first thing you would want to do is ask the users for input on the software. What are their likes and dislikes, why would they be more likely to use or not use our product.
Creating user stories allows us to organize the information we have been given via the users, we can manage them by priority and level of difficulty. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
First would be creating a diagram and outline for the project as a whole. This gives us a starting point and we can manage where we are going and how much time we have left. 
I hope to incorporate Sprints into my future developement, I like the idea of daily scrum meetings and working together as a group. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member needs to be able to communicate effectively with their group. Without communication the Agile process breaks down very quickly.
Having a positive attitude and being a hard worker are also qualities that most people would like to see in their team members.
